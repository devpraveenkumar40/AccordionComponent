They can be single-valued or objects having a set of values that will be passed to components of React during creation by using a naming convention that almost looks similar to HTML-tag attributes. We can say that props are the data passed from a parent component into a child component.",

    text: "React Hooks are the built-in functions that permit developers for using the state and lifecycle methods within React components. These are newly added features made available in React 16.8 version. Each lifecycle of a component is having 3 phases which include mount, unmount, and update. Along with that, components have properties and states. Hooks will allow using these methods by developers for improving the reuse of code with higher flexibility navigating the component tree.",
